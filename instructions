t how to set up. This is a test page hosted locally on docker

you need docker installed
we are creating our own container and image
these are initiated in the dockerfile
so far no docker compose.. yet?



SIMPLIFIED ie to start just run the python file "STARTUP.py"
then http://localhost:8000/


do:
docker build -t practicesite . (image name is practicesite but this step is naming it, . is in this directory)

docker images (check which images you have)

now lauch docker, check in docker desktop and remember to end it after. (container named here, image name as before)
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name practicesite practicesite


host page:
http://localhost:8000

to update page after editing
docker cp index.html practicesite:/htmlproject/index.html

and refresh browser


to stop docker
(use container name)
docker stop practicesite

dont remake it because it wont work anyways since it already exists
docker restart practicesite
